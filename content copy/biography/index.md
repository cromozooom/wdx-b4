> My art captures the atmosphere suspended between **reality and dream**, in an intimate and inner dimension that lives in our memory and expectation.It is not a flight from reality in the narrow sense, but the search for **a place of peace and tranquillity** in which we could lose and find ourselves and then look again at the many miracles that surround us.

At the opening of the [89th RGA Annual Exhibition](https://www.calinalefter.com/exhibitions/rga-89th-annual-exhibition/) at the Reading Museum, Diana Seidl offered the [MARIE DYSON Award](https://www.rga-artists.org.uk/marie-dyson-award.html) to Calina Lefter:

> There is real vibrancy and personality in the way the paint has been applied. The artist displays strong control of the compositional elements of the picture - making it work as a whole. Also a great use of colour and texture in the paint. The inclusion of the birds is crucial as it makes a centre of focus and a different tempo in the painting.

## Recensioni

> Calina Lefter parte dalla visione realistica del paesaggio per creare mondi irreali tessuti con minuzia e costruiti, attraverso l’inserimento di materiali eterogenei, come minuscoli gioielli. I paesaggi - ora astratti, ora volutamente fedeli alla verità della natura – appaiono come meditate fughe che riproducono, grazie alla morbidezza della stoffa e alla delicatezza dei materiali, visioni di mondi lontani, placidi rifugi in cui è impossibile percepire la ruvidezza della realtà."

\-- _Daniela Ambrosio about - Calina Lefter_

## Alchimie tattili

> Artist from the poetic and introspective vein, Calina Lefter takes inspiration from the real landscape view to create imaginary worlds of remarkable lyrical intensity, enriched by bright flashes and interesting polymateric contrasts.\
> Her favourite subjects are natural landscapes of great breath captured in special moments of the day and witnesses of the progressive change of seasons, or still life, in home-made interiors of metaphysical imprint, where time seems so dilated to appear almost absent.Everything lies suspended between reality and dream, in an intimate and inner dimension that lives in memory and expectation.\
> \
> Observing her work carefully, she sees a material stratification, but also of slow, gradual, cured and methodical meaning, aimed at the ultimate achievement of a compositional harmony that can attract the spectator in a new and sensual context.It is difficult to resist the temptation to touch with the hand the tactile surfaces of her paintings: ripples of colour, dripping and a great variety of fabrics, now soft, now stiffer, now smooth and now perforated; these seem to wait for us to bring us back.\
> \
> I remember the feelings already experienced before.Dialogue between so many different materials is tight; a compositional game that reveals a lively and passionate experimentalism that leaves the free matter of expression through those properties that are their own. The artist seems to be orchestrating with tonal modulation mastery which, following each other, suggests a brilliant and well-calibrated rhythm made of long pauses and counterpoint. The large spots of colour, animated by innumerable colours, alternate with elements of their own specificity and careful detail, forcing the eye to follow an irregular path and to dwell on certain details and then, mentally, to rebuild their own; a vision that is not only the visual evidence suggested by the painter but a unique and personal vision.\
> \
> The titles of the works themselves, **"Drops of Stars", "Rain Today", "Waiting for Dinner" and "Winter Night"**, reveal this desire to stop a particular moment of your life, crystallize their moods and transpose on the canvas a feeling that can be captured and shared by others. They also reveal conflicting feelings: a delicate and enveloping melancholy, drained in the warm and bright vision of so many dear and beloved natural landscapes, where to refresh the mind tired of the afflictions of everyday life. \
> \
> It is not a flight from reality in the narrow sense, but the search for a place of peace and tranquillity in which we lose and find again, and then look again with the many miracles that surround us.
